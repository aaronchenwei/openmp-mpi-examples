//  Purpose:
//
//    HELLO has each thread print out its ID.
//
//  Discussion:
//
//    HELLO is a "Hello, World" program for OpenMP.
//
//    But we demonstrate a few simple features of OpenMP, including:
//
//    How you get the "include" file.
//    How you measure wall clock time.
//    How you find out how many processors are available.
//    How you find out which thread you are in a parallel section.
//    How you find out how many threads are available in a parallel section.
//    How you set the number of threads.
//
